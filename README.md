# Coursera_Capstone
Coursera Captstone Project

This was an early project as part of my Coursera IBM Data Science Certification. Also the first time using Jupyter Notebooks, as previously I had only used IDE's.

It uses data from 4Square to identify the locations of Grocery Stores, then uses data from the ONS for population to grocery store ratio to identify locations for building new Grocery Stores.
